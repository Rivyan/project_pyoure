## Product Outline

In this project I am building a portfolio site for a client. The main theme is photography, showcasing some of her work.

The main idea is to split the site into to different side: Moments for family style shooting and Women for lone female style shooting.

To achieve good SEO and optimization, I am going to use React.js with Next.js.
